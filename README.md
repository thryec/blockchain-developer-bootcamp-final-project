# Final Project Idea 

Overview: A web-based dashboard that gives a P&L summary of all token and NFT holdings of an individual user. Data should be updated in real-time (ideally) through API calls to relevant sites (e.g. Coinmarketcap/Opensea API), and show changes in asset value over time. 

# Workflow Example

1. Users will visit the url of this site, which prompts them to connec their Metamask wallet. 
2. The Dapp will obtain historical transaction data from the user's wallet and represent this data on the front-end to be viewed by the user. 
3. The user will be able view his token balance, NFTs, and P&L split by each category (potentially have the option to toggle between showing USD values and BTC values). 


# Extension

If possible, connect wallets from different blockchains/show balances of multiple Metamask accounts (?)
